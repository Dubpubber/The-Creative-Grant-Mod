Project stopped indefinitely. See paragraph below for further information. Thanks everyone! 

# Project Purpose and Information
This project, in its infancy, was to open up the community to the possibilities of the modding api for Prison Architect and explore the new options as they were released to the modding community in an attempt to fully blossum Prison Architect. However, by no choice of my own, I'm afraid the goal of this project has failed as the developers have moved on and didn't give the modding api as much structure as I once hoped. I appreciate my users supporting this project and close colleagues who put time into this project. We tried but sometimes the what we can do is limited by our creators!

With that, the Creative-Grant-Mod is now shutdown and further updates canceled. Thanks for your understanding and I look forward to moving onto different games with hopefully better modding community saturation.

## Copy this project, please!

Since somebody has to do it, I'm pushing YOU to use this mod to inspire your own creative ideas! Please, let's get this community rolling and push the developers to give us the tools we need! The more references I see the more features I'll add! Thanks so much for your participation! 

Though not required, I'd love if you do use this project as reference for your idea... How about sending a little bit of love my way? Rate this, star github, say thank you, give credit, whatever you want to do. Doesn't mean much but it means people care. Thanks!
