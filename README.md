# The-Creative-Grant-Mod
A very early implementation of a trainer for the popular tycoon game known as "Prison Architect"!
Inspired by Introversions in game development kit and the lack of modding options through the LUA API, I'm happy to introduce the newly rebranded TGM to "The Creative Trainer Mod"! Finally, a mod the packs the most into a game that refuses to give modders the options we need to make the game even more powerful. Enough of that, check out the features!

#Features
 - Temporary Bodyguards (Highly Experimental! Use with caution!)
 - Spawn a fire and then swiftly put it out!
 - Taze anyone that attempts to escape.
 - Infect patient zero with the virus, simulate quarantine.
 - Spawn 1, 2 or 3 prisoners at once!
 - Fully open source on GitHub! Copy, modify, and reference whatever you like! 
 - Of course, unlock the power of cash with 10 money giving grants!
 - Build every single item instantly.
 - Research instantly after a warden is placed!
 - Reform programs now made easy.
 - There is so much more that can done. More to come!

Are you a curious little butterfly and noticed there are new features not yet pushed into the steam branch of development!? OH HOW CRUEL OF ME. Anyways, if you're reading this: show your support, man. I need to know someone out there appreciates/uses this software. Thanks! Dubpubber
