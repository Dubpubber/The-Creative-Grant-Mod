Title: "The Creative Trainer Mod 4.6 [For 1.1 - Start a riot, Give Contraband, Spawn Inmates!]"

Inspired by Introversions in game development kit and the lack of modding options through the LUA API, I'm happy to introduce the newly rebranded TGM to "The Creative Trainer Mod"! Finally, a mod that packs the most into a game that refuses to give modders the options we need to make the game even more powerful. Enough of that, check out the features!

[h1]Features[/h1]
 - Temporary [b]Bodyguards[/b] (Highly Experimental! Use with caution!)
 - Spawn a fire and then swiftly put it out!
 - Taze anyone that attempts to escape.
 - Infect patient zero with the virus, simulate quarantine.
 - Spawn 1, 2 or 3 prisoners at once!
 - Equip all prisoners with random contraband then start a riot! Then end the riot!
 - Place random contraband anywhere on the map!
 - Spawn a random category inmate!
 - Fully open source on GitHub! Copy, modify, and reference whatever you like!
 - Of course, unlock the power of cash with 10 money giving grants!
 - Build every single item instantly.
 - Research instantly after a warden is placed!
 - Reform programs now made easy.
 - There is so much more that can done. More to come!

[h1]Usage and Installation[/h1]
The Creative Trainer mod behaves in a way you're not typically acustomed to. Other in game trainers like Grand Theft Auto offer graphical interfaces - this mod provides its features through a series of objects found in the "Staff" menu. You place these objects on the map and the corresponding action takes place.

Like all mods for prison architect, it's activated through the extras menu, checking this mod, and hitting apply.

Since somebody has to do it, I'm pushing [b][i]YOU[/i][/b] to use this mod to inspire your own creative ideas! Please, let's get this community rolling and push the developers to give us the tools we need! The more references I see the more features I'll add! Thanks so much for your participation!

[h1]Want this mod but still want the old prices? Look here![/h1]
You can download the mod manually and install a "no price mod" [url=https://onedrive.live.com/redir?resid=C4D5022B3F8AFA11!4262&authkey=!AHRtJTt3opDhopg&ithint=file%2czip]here.[/url] The no price edition of this mod makes it so all the vanilla prices are intact but all the super cool features are in as well!
